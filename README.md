# Moonshot SwiftUI Project (Hacking with Swift)

This repository contains my implementation of the Moonshot project from Paul Hudson's Hacking with Swift SwiftUI tutorial series.

## Project Overview

The Moonshot project is a SwiftUI application that displays information about the Apollo missions, including astronaut details and mission specifics. It demonstrates various SwiftUI concepts such as:

* **Grid layouts:** Using `LazyVGrid` to display mission data.
* **Navigation:** Employing `NavigationView` and `NavigationLink` for navigating between mission details and astronaut information.
* **Data loading from JSON:** Parsing mission and astronaut data from JSON files.
* **Custom views:** Creating reusable components for displaying mission and astronaut information.
* **Scroll views:** Utilizing `ScrollView` for displaying detailed mission descriptions.
* **Formatting dates:** Using `DateFormatter` to present mission launch dates in a user-friendly format.
* **Image loading and resizing:** Displaying astronaut images and mission flags.
* **Accessibility:** Adding accessibility labels and hints to improve user experience.

## Features

* Displays a grid of Apollo missions with mission names and launch dates.
* Provides detailed information about each mission, including crew members and mission description.
* Shows astronaut profiles with their biography and image.
* Displays the crew members name and role in the mission.

## Future Work

* Need to determine why I am unable to load the images into the project and fix this bug.

## Technologies Used

* SwiftUI
* JSON

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, I gained experience in:

* Working with SwiftUI layouts and navigation.
* Parsing JSON data in Swift.
* Creating reusable SwiftUI components.
* Improving accessibility in SwiftUI.
